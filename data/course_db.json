Principles of software design, project management and team work are developed in the lectures and tutorials, and students apply these concepts in the laboratories as they work in a team to design and implement a complex software system. Students learn and practice oral and written communication techniques in lectures and in meetings with their communication instructor, and apply these techniques in a variety of documents and presentations, such as short status reports and longer design proposals and design reviews. Students learn software development tools such as version control (git), debuggers, code verifiers and unit test frameworks and gain experience in graphical user interface design and algorithm development.",

      "description": "As computers permeate our society, the security of such computing systems is becoming of paramount importance. This course covers principles of computer systems security. To build secure systems, one must understand how attackers operate. This course starts by teaching students how to identify security vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. Then techniques to create secure systems and defend against such attacks will be discussed. Industry standards for conducting security audits to establish levels of security will be introduced. The course will include an introduction to basic cryptographic techniques as well as hardware used to accelerate cryptographic operations in ATM's and webservers.",

Then, the kinematics and kinetics of systems of particles and solid bodies are examined. Finally, simple harmonic motion is discussed. The occurrence of dynamic motion in natural systems, such as planetary motion, is emphasized. Applications to engineered systems are also introduced.",
